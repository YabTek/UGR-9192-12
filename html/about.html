                <h1 id="bg">My background</h1>
                <p>My name is Yeabsira Tekuamwork.I was born in 1994 at a little town,Woreilu.It is 
                    located in the south wollo zone of Amhara region.My childhood was very interesting.
                    It was full of fun and play.I have completed my elementary and my high school upto 
                    grade 10 there.My childhood was very interesting.But after grade 11,I came to Addis
                    Ababa and took a university entrance examination here at Addis Ababa.When I came 
                    here,everything was new for me.Adapting the environment,meeting new friends was 
                    difficult.My mother helped me alot in my education.She wants me to become successful and
                    she tried many ways to make me a cleaver student since my early ages.
                </p>
                </div>
                <div class="now">
                <h1 id="nw">Now?</h1>
                <p>Now,I am a sofware engineering student at Addis Ababa university.I love the course so 
                   much and I love learning here because it is a well known university in Ethiopia.As the
                   teachers are highly qualified,they give us a new insight of the course everytime.I am sure
                   this will help me become successful and qualified.
                </p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="strength">
                <h1 id="stre">My strength</h1>
                <p>One of my strengths is honesty.My mother always tells me to be honest and I think I have
                   developed this discipline.I choose to be honest in my every activities.I am also good at
                   time management.Managing time is a key for living life in organized way.That is why I
                   always try to use my time properly.Self criticism is my other strength.I want to be
                   responsible for my own actions.Nobody will take care of my mistakes,in many ways I don't 
                   blame others for my wrong actions.Rather I will try to solve it by correcting my flaws.
                   And also am kind of strong person for what I belived to do.I want to accomplish my plans 
                   without others distruction.
                </p>

               <div class="weakness">
               <h1 id="wek">My weakness</h1>
                <p>I do have weaknesses that I have to overcome and improve.One of my weaknesses is 
                   lack of confidence.My lack of confidence has made me underestimate my self in many 
                   situations.I am also not good at communication.Most of the time I afraid to talk to 
                   people specially for the first time.But in this field communication is very essential,
                   I have to improve this.Lack of patience is my other weakness.I want things to become
                   like I thought them to be with in a short period of time.
